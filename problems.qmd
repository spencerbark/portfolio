title: "Problems I’m Exploring"
---

This page outlines real problems I personally experience and think are worth solving. The goal
is to practice product thinking by clearly framing user pain, explaining why it matters, and
presenting each as a legitimate product opportunity.

## 1) Internship application tracking is fragmented
**Description:** Recruiting involves deadlines, follow-ups, networking conversations, and notes
spread across email, spreadsheets, calendars, and reminders. Important context gets lost and
follow-through becomes inconsistent.

**Why it matters to me:** Balancing school and recruiting gets overwhelming quickly, and missing a
follow-up or deadline can directly impact outcomes.

**Why it’s worth solving:** A lightweight system that combines deadlines, relationship context, and
next actions could significantly improve recruiting effectiveness without adding more complexity.

## 2) Students don’t know which skills to prioritize for target roles
**Description:** Job descriptions are often vague, leaving students unsure which skills will have
the highest impact. Many end up learning tools randomly rather than intentionally.

**Why it matters to me:** Time is limited, and I want my learning to map clearly to real roles and
expectations.

**Why it’s worth solving:** A clear skills-to-role map with assessments and learning paths could help
students upskill faster and demonstrate readiness.

## 3) Financial decisions feel unclear because information is scattered
**Description:** Budgeting, saving, investing, and major purchases are deeply connected, but most
tools separate them, making tradeoffs difficult to evaluate.

**Why it matters to me:** I’ve learned that clarity leads to better decisions and more consistent
follow-through.

**Why it’s worth solving:** A unified view of financial tradeoffs across time, risk, and cash flow
could help people make confident, informed decisions.

## 4) Group projects suffer from unclear ownership
**Description:** In many teams, responsibilities and expectations are implicit. Tasks slip through
the cracks even when everyone is motivated.

**Why it matters to me:** I’ve seen strong teams underperform due to coordination issues rather than
lack of effort.

**Why it’s worth solving:** Clear ownership, simple workflows, and shared definitions of success can
dramatically improve team outcomes.

## 5) Productivity advice isn’t contextual
**Description:** Most productivity systems assume an ideal schedule and don’t adapt to changing
priorities, deadlines, or workload spikes.

**Why it matters to me:** Managing classes, projects, and recruiting requires a system grounded in
real constraints.

**Why it’s worth solving:** Context-aware planning tools could reduce stress and help people execute
more consistently.
