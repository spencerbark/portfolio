## Overview

This project is a lightweight productivity application I built to practice core product
management and rapid prototyping skills. The focus was on shipping a simple, functional MVP
quickly rather than building a feature-heavy system.

I used this project to move from a loosely defined idea to a deployed application, learning
how product decisions around scope, usability, and speed affect the final outcome.

## Problem

Managing tasks can quickly become overwhelming when information is scattered across notes,
reminders, and apps. Even simple task lists often feel heavier than necessary, creating
friction for basic planning.

I wanted to explore how a minimal interface could reduce that friction and make task entry
and tracking feel fast and intuitive.

## Solution

The AI PM Todo App is a simple web-based todo list designed for non-technical users. It features a clean, friendly interface that makes task management intuitive and frictionless—no learning curve required.
