<h1>Spencer Bark</h1>

<p class="lead">
I’m a student at Brigham Young University interested in product management, strategy,
and how AI can be used to build better products.
</p>

<p>
This portfolio highlights projects and experiments I’m working on this semester as I learn
how to identify real problems, build quick prototypes, and test ideas with real users.
